            <h1>Rock Paper Scissors with the Grim Reaper</h1>
            <h3>You have one chance to save your life</h3>
            <p>You're walking to your favorite lunch place, when you notice the kid next to you darting the street after 
                his basketball that rolled down the street. There's a truck coming down the street.
            </p>
            <p>Based on pure instinct, you chase after the kid and push him onto the sidewalk.</p>
            <p>Everything suddenly stops. You sense a presences next to you.</p>
            <p>You turn around and see the Grim Reaper next to you.</p>
            <p>"Am I dead?" you ask</p>
            <p>"No," he says, "you are in the space between life and death right now, but you will be soon."</p>
            <p>"Since you lived your life to your fullest and your life is in jeapordy because you did a good deed,
                I can give you one chance to save your life."
            </p>
            <p>"Play a game of rock, paper, scissors with me."</p>
            <p>"If you win, it'll be like nothing happened. You'll go back to living your life until the next time we meet."</p>
            <p>"If you lose, I'll have to take you back to the afterlife as planned."</p>
